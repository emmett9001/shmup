TODO
don't load patterns all at once
    put all loaded patterns into a structure
    only create them when they should come onscreen
hotkey that clears the screen of all bullets, doesn't kill any patterns or
    movers
hit key to drop into "play mode"
in play mode, scroll starts upward from checkpoint and you die if you get hit
save out coordinates in an infinite coordinate space
cyclic bounded mover should edit like this:
    click from start point to end point, rather than from center to one apex
margins around the screen in edit mode to allow placement of invisible markers
    eg "when you get here, speed up the scrolling"
    or "restart from here in play mode"

DONE
currently highlighted pattern should highlight its bullets, all others should
    be half hidden
click to highlight, rather than mouseover
infinite scroll up and down
