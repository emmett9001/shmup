TODO
hit key to drop into "play mode"
in play mode, scroll starts upward from checkpoint and you die if you get hit
save out coordinates in an infinite coordinate space
cyclic bounded mover should edit like this:
    click from start point to end point, rather than from center to one apex
margins around the screen in edit mode to allow placement of invisible markers
    eg "when you get here, speed up the scrolling"
    or "restart from here in play mode"

DONE
